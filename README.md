# clip - Command Line Intro Player

Currently this is an "internal" project what helps running the C64intros 24/7 live twitch channel at:
https://www.twitch.tv/c64intros

At the moment it's not intended to release this to the big public, code is "as is", and comments are rare.

If you find here something useful, feel free to (re)use it for your own purposes :)
