What is a cracktro? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_intro

If there is no sound, don't panic. Not every intro contains music. This is especially true for intros created before 1990.

This channel is entirely based on automated uploads, with the videos being separate recordings from the C64intros live Twitch channel. If you notice any errors or issues, please contact me at:
c64intros@gmail.com
The recordings were made with VICE emulator on PC, not on original hardware, so the movement of objects on the screen and scrolling may not be smooth. This is a technical limitation of emulators and the fact that our modern flat displays do not operate at 50Hz anymore.
This YouTube channel is in no way affiliated with intros.c64.org; it simply utilizes the freely available and downloadable intros on the website.
